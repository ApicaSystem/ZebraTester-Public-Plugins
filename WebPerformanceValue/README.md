# WebPerformanceValue
Plugin that allows for custom integer values to be passed from a ZebraTester script into ASM, to be displayed in the "Value" column of the "Check Details" screen. Generally, the "Response Time" (e.g. 2002 ms) of the check will be displayed in the "Value" column, but this plugin allows for any calculated integer to be displayed instead. Currently ASM allows for several different Result Unit\ values for the "Value" column for ZebraTester checks. The unit value can be set in the "Result Unit" subsection of the "Edit Check" page to different values, including None, ms (milliseconds), b (bytes), and more.
